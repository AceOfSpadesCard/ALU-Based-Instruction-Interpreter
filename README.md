# ALU-Based Instruction Interpreter
This is an elementary ALU-Based Instruction Interpreter written in MicroPython and intended to be run on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
It has the capability to display custom clock speed through and LED if you uncomment lines 204, 214 and 216.
Additionally, if you remove those lines along with line 2, you can adapt the program to run on any Python interpreter, not just the Raspberry Pi Pico.
