# CPUSimulator
This is a complex CPU Simulator written in MicroPython and intended to be run on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
It is designed based on my custom architecture called Spade CPU architecture.
Note that this is a emulator functionaing like a basic CPU, and written in a way that emulates how a CPU works
